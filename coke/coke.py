# Implement a program that prompts the user to insert a coin, one at a time,

# Info due amount to user each time.

# Once the user has inputted at least 50 cents, output how many cents in change the user is owed.

# Assume that the user will only input integers, and ignore any integer that isnâ€™t an accepted denomination.
