# ### Breaking down the problem
# Expects zero or two command-line arguments
# Prompts the user for a str of text.
# Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.
# Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font,
# If this is the case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.
# The program should exit via sys.exit with an error message if first is not -f or --font or the second is not the name of a font.
# Outputs that text in the desired font.
