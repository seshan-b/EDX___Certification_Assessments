### Breaking down the problem
# Implement a program that prompts the user for items, one per line, until the user inputs control-d
# Then output the user’s grocery list in all uppercase, sorted alphabetically by item.
# Prefixing each line with the number of times the user inputted that item
# No need to pluralize the items. Treat the user’s input case-insensitively.
