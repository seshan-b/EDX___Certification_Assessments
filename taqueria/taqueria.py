#  Implement a program that enables a user to place an order
# prompting them for items, one per line, until the user inputs control-d
# After each inputted item, display the total cost of all items inputted thus far, prefixed with a dollar sign ($)
# Treat the user’s input case insensitively. Ignore any input that isn’t an item.
# Assume that every item on the menu will be title-cased.
