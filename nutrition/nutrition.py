### Breaking down the problem
# Use a conditional with 20 Boolean expressions
# One for each fruit,
# Use a dict to associate a fruit with its calories!
# If k is a str and d is a dict, you can check whether k is a key in d with code like:
# Eg: if k in d:



# 1. Initialize a dictionary called `fruit_calories` with fruit names as keys and their calorie counts as values.

# 2. Create a list called `fruits` containing the names of the fruits to check.

# 3. Loop through each fruit in the `fruits` list:
#    a. Check if the fruit is in the `fruit_calories` dictionary.
#    b. If the fruit is in the dictionary, print the fruit and its calorie count.
#    c. If the fruit is not in the dictionary, print that the fruit is not found.

# 4. End the loop.
